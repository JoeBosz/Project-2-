Proposal

We would like to create a website that brings together a community of wine enthusiast and collectors alike. A place to expand your wine collection and pallets, while tracking your personal wine inventory.

I am favoring an certain type of wine but I would like to expand my collection and pallet

We have any collection . Collectors can search and add!

using Node.Js
