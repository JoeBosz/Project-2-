## WINEVYBE

## Description

This application is designed to create a space for wine collectors to come together and create a profile. They will be able to keep tabs and update their wine collection as they expand their inventory and pallets.

## Usage

First you will be presented with the homepage where you will create an account or login if you already have one. You will then be redirected to our wine collections where you can see wine listings and prices.
